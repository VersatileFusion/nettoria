# VMware vCenter/ESXi Connectivity Diagnostic Report

## Summary of Findings
Based on extensive testing of the vCenter server at `test.vahabstormzone.info` (IP: 84.241.8.88), we have identified several connection issues that are causing problems with both the SOAP and REST APIs.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Connection Reset (ECONNRESET)**
   - All connection attempts are being actively reset by the server
   - This indicates the server is reachable (IP and port are valid) but is actively refusing connections
   - The connection reset happens both with hostname and direct IP address

2. **TLS/SSL Issues**
   - Various TLS versions (TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3) all encountered similar reset issues
   - TLS handshake cannot complete due to the connection being terminated

3. **Network Restrictions**
   - The consistent connection resets suggest an active firewall or security device is blocking connections
   - This is different from a port being closed (which would time out) or a service being unavailable (which would return HTTP errors)

## Probable Causes

1. **Firewall Rules**
   - A network security device (firewall, IPS, WAF) is likely blocking the connections
   - The device may be configured to allow connections only from specific IP addresses/networks
   - The firewall might be set to actively reject unauthorized connection attempts

2. **Access Control Lists**
   - The vCenter server itself may have configured restrictions to only allow connections from specific management networks
   - VMware's security settings can restrict API access based on network origin

3. **Server Configuration**
   - The vCenter server may be configured to only respond to certain hostnames in the request
   - API services might be running on non-standard ports that weren't tested

4. **Certificate Requirements**
   - The server may require client certificates for API access
   - TLS settings might be restricted to specific cipher suites

## Recommendations

1. **Network Access Verification**:
   - Confirm with your network administrator that your current IP address/network is allowed to access the vCenter server
   - Request that your IP address be added to any allow lists on firewalls or security devices

2. **Authentication Method**:
   - Verify that the credentials you're using have API access permissions
   - Ensure your account has the correct roles assigned in vCenter

3. **Alternative Connection Methods**:
   - Try connecting through a VPN that places you in the allowed management network
   - If available, try connecting from a jumpbox/bastion host that is known to have access

4. **Server Configuration Check**:
   - Verify with the vCenter administrator that the API services are enabled
   - Confirm which ports should be used for API access (standard is 443, but could be customized)
   - Check if there are specific requirements for API clients (headers, certificates, etc.)

5. **Client Configuration**:
   - Try using a different client library that might handle the TLS handshake differently
   - Test with VMware's official tools like PowerCLI or the vSphere client

6. **Alternative API Endpoint**:
   - If you're trying to manage VMware infrastructure, see if there's an alternative management endpoint available
   - ESXi hosts can sometimes be accessed directly if vCenter is unavailable

## Testing Details

The following tests were conducted:

1. Basic TCP connectivity to ports 443, 8443, 9443 and others
2. HTTPS connectivity with various SSL/TLS options
3. Authentication tests with multiple credential methods
4. Raw TLS connection tests to diagnose handshake issues
5. DNS resolution checks for proper name resolution
6. Testing with both hostname and direct IP address

All tests showed consistent connection reset behavior, indicating an active blocking rather than a service configuration issue.

## Next Steps

1. Contact the vCenter administrator to confirm:
   - API access requirements
   - Network access control policies
   - Required authentication methods
   - API service status and configuration

2. Work with your network team to:
   - Verify network route to the vCenter server
   - Check for any packet filtering or deep inspection that might interfere with API connections
   - Request any necessary firewall exceptions

3. Try alternative tools:
   - VMware's official PowerCLI
   - Browser-based access to the vCenter UI
   - Direct ESXi host connection if possible
